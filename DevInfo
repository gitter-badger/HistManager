[TO-DO]
01. rename: khist=hist, khtxt=htxt, ~/=~/HISTMANAGER (for holding files pre installation)
02. Apply Name Convention : https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Naming#Naming
03. rewrite 0.1 - 0.7 histmanager submenus to use python decorator syntax - seperate io/error proofing from actual actions - streamline sysenv handling
04. Document:
    4.1 ReDocument including reStructuredText markup
    4.2 Use sphinx to covert/generate and host python documentation
    4.3 Run pylint over entire python code
    4.4 move all shell documentation to the usage() function
    4.5 rtfd.io
05. Refactor as package/module, make importable : https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Main#Main
06. Include version number and error contact, licence, push to Git, deploy over web (6)
07. Installer should quit/uninstall if an error occurs during installation
08. check for update at startup
09. upon uninstall - offer to auto email errorlog to histmanager@gmail.com // upload errorlog (design webform to post files / design webform to post links (generated via a pastebin-sharer, shortened)) to project site.
10. Distribute via project site / ppa / proper .deb build binary
11. support multi-tab / multiple terminals
12. export to Ubuntu (dash), OSx
13. create a .travis.yml file, allow automated testing

[SOLVED]
remove slow printing welmes - interruption can be fatal ####welmes should be command prompt input to python, and printed via python
Enter returns to settings menu
Master cant be renamed, archived, etc
Change dialogue on fisrt startup - "exporting .. from previous session"
Enter starts from previous environment
Merge history environments
disallow 'archive' in names
rename archive and merge shouldnt always be allowed
reorder settings menu
deleted "Can't retreive prior environment settings to use as default" message
installer should ensure python3 is installed and act accordingly
Dump stacktrace to debuglog.khtxt, print appropriate message to screen
