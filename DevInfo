[TO-DO]
01. rename: khist=hist, khtxt=htxt, ~/=~/HISTMANAGER (for holding files pre installation)
02. Apply Name Convention : https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Naming#Naming
03. modularise - consolidate repetitive `input error proofing code`, `display code`, `lines exceeding 80 characters`etc
04. Document:
    4.1 ReDocument including reStructuredText markup
    4.2 Use sphinx to covert/generate and host python documentation
    4.3 Run pylint over entire python code
    4.4 move all shell documentation to the usage() function
05. Refactor as package/module, make importable : https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Main#Main
06. Include version number and error contact, licence, push to Git, deploy over web (6)
07. Installer should quit/uninstall if an error occurs during installation
08. check for update at startup
09. upon uninstall - upload errorlog (design webform to post files / design webform to post links (generated via my pastebin-sharer)) to project site.
10. Distribute via project site
11. support multi-tab / multiple terminals
12. export to Ubuntu (dash), OSx

[SOLVED]
remove slow printing welmes - interruption can be fatal ####welmes should be command prompt input to python, and printed via python
Enter returns to settings menu
Master cant be renamed, archived, etc
Change dialogue on fisrt startup - "exporting .. from previous session"
Enter starts from previous environment
Merge history environments
disallow 'archive' in names
rename archive and merge shouldnt always be allowed
reorder settings menu
deleted "Can't retreive prior environment settings to use as default" message
installer should ensure python3 is installed and act accordingly
Dump stacktrace to debuglog.khtxt, print appropriate message to screen

[QUIRKS AND HACKS]
Instead of choosing environment by index, name can by typed
All environment names are case-insensitive
Pressing enter at settings submenus takes you back to settings (eg in 0.2 -> oname or nname being '' return to settings)
Pressing enter at settings menu return to environment menu
Pressing enter at environment menu loads previous env (if any)
+-_ are allowed in environment names
history is archived pre-merge
typing decimals 0.1 through 0.6 leads straight to settings submenus, other 0.x decimals lead to main settings menu
(y/n) menus accept (Y/N), (yes/no) too
negative values at viewhist submenu cause alphabetically sorted output

[STRATEGY]
The history of the bash terminal, by default, is stored in the ~/.bash_history file. HistManager works by constantly editing this file - replacing it with a different file (based on the environment history the user wants to import). This way, the system still uses the default, .bash_history file to both add and retrieve commands, but the file iself is replaced by HistManager - thus changing the history entirely. Additions to environment histories also occur this way - the system edits the .bash_history file, and the edits are copied into the relevant environment history file. Apart from all the user gernerated environments, there is another, 'Master' environment - which can't be merged, renamed, or archived. This environment is special, as it contains all the history, from all the environments. Thus, selecting the Master environment has the same effect as continuing with the default history management.
